TOOL_DESCRIPTION[

] = f"""\
This tool is used to answer questions that can be answered using the information \
present in the connected documents that will largely be private to the organization/user.
Note that the search tool is not well suited for time-ordered questions (e.g., '...latest email...', \
'...last 2 jiras resolved...') and answering aggregation-type questions (e.g., 'how many...') \
(unless that info is present in the connected documents). If there are better suited tools \
for answering those questions, use them instead.
You generally should not need to ask clarification questions about the topics being searched for \
by the {INTERNAL_SEARCH} tool, as the retrieved documents will likely provide you with more context.
Each request to the {INTERNAL_SEARCH} tool should largely be written as a SEARCH QUERY, and NOT as a question \
or an instruction! Also, \
The {INTERNAL_SEARCH} tool DOES support parallel calls of up to {MAX_DR_PARALLEL_SEARCH} queries.

] = f"""\
This tool is used to answer questions that can be answered using the information \
that is public on the internet. The {INTERNET_SEARCH} tool DOES support parallel calls of up to \
{MAX_DR_PARALLEL_SEARCH} queries.
USAGE HINTS:
  - Since the {INTERNET_SEARCH} tool is not well suited for time-ordered questions (e.g., '...latest publication...', \
if questions of this type would be the actual goal, you should send questions to the \
{INTERNET_SEARCH} tool of the type '... RECENT publications...', and trust that future language model \
calls will be able to find the 'latest publication' from within the results.
"""

TOOL_DESCRIPTION[
    DRPath.KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH
] = f"""\
This tool is similar to a search tool but it answers questions based on \
entities and relationships extracted from the source documents. \
It is suitable for answering complex questions about specific entities and relationships, such as \
"summarize the open tickets assigned to John in the last month". \
It can also query a relational database containing the entities and relationships, allowing it to \
answer aggregation-type questions like 'how many jiras did each employee close last month?'. \
However, the {KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH} tool MUST ONLY BE USED if the question can be answered with the \
entity/relationship types that are available in the knowledge graph. (So even if the user is \
asking for the Knowledge Graph to be used but the question/request does not directly relate \
to entities/relationships in the knowledge graph, do not use the {KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH} tool.).
Note that the {KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH} tool can both FIND AND ANALYZE/AGGREGATE/QUERY the relevant documents/entities. \
E.g., if the question is "how many open jiras are there", you should pass that as a single query to the \
{KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH} tool, instead of splitting it into finding and counting the open jiras.
Note also that the {KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH} tool is slower than the standard search tools.
Importantly, the {KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH} tool can also analyze the relevant documents/entities, so DO NOT \
try to first find documents and then analyze them in a future iteration. Query the {KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH} \
tool directly, like 'summarize the most recent jira created by John'.
Lastly, to use the {KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH} tool, it is important that you know the specific entity/relation type being \
referred to in the question. If it cannot reasonably be inferred, consider asking a clarification question.
On the other hand, the {KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH} tool does NOT require attributes to be specified. I.e., it is possible \
to search for entities without narrowing down specific attributes. Thus, if the question asks for an entity or \
an entity type in general, you should not ask clarification questions to specify the attributes. \
"""

TOOL_DESCRIPTION[

This tool does not directly have access to the documents, but will use the results from \
previous tool calls to generate a comprehensive final answer. It should always be called exactly once \

the most relevant information to answer the question. You can also skip straight to the {CLOSER} \

MISCELLANEOUS HINTS:
   - it is CRITICAL to look at the high-level plan and try to evaluate which steps seem to be \
satisfactorily answered, or which areas need more research/information.
   - if you think a) you can answer the question with the information you already have AND b) \
the information from the high-level plan has been sufficiently answered in enough detail, then \
you can use the "{CLOSER}" tool.
   - please first consider whether you already can answer the question with the information you already have. \
Also consider whether the plan suggests you are already done. If so, you can use the "{CLOSER}" tool.
   - if you think more information is needed because a sub-question was not sufficiently answered, \
you can generate a modified version of the previous step, thus effectively modifying the plan.
   - you can only consider a tool that fits the remaining time budget! The tool cost must be below \
the remaining time budget.
   - if some earlier claims seem to be contradictory or require verification, you can do verification \
questions assuming it fits the tool in question.
   - you may want to ask some exploratory question that is not directly driving towards the final answer, \
but that will help you to get a better understanding of the information you need to answer the original question. \
Examples here could be trying to understand a market, a customer segment, a product, a technology etc. better, \
which should help you to ask better follow-up questions.
   - be careful not to repeat nearly the same question in the same tool again! If you did not get a \
good answer from one tool you may want to query another tool for the same purpose, but only of the \
new tool seems suitable for the question! If a very similar question for a tool earlier gave something like \
"The documents do not explicitly mention ...." then  it should be clear that that tool has been exhausted \
for that query!
  - Again, focus is on generating NEW INFORMATION! Try to generate questions that
      - address gaps in the information relative to the original question
      - are interesting follow-ups to questions answered so far, if you think the user would be interested in it.
      - checks whether the original piece of information is correct, or whether it is missing some details.

  - Again, DO NOT repeat essentially the same question usiong the same tool!! WE DO ONLY WANT GENUNINELY \
NEW INFORMATION!!! So if dor example an earlier question to the SEARCH tool was "What is the main problem \
that Nike has?" and the answer was "The documents do not explicitly discuss a specific problem...", DO NOT \
ask to the SEARCH tool on the next opportunity something like "Is there a problem that was mentioned \
by Nike?", as this would be essentially the same question as the one answered by the SEARCH tool earlier.


YOUR TASK:
you need to construct the next question and the tool to send it to. To do so, please consider \

GET_CLARIFICATION_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    f"""\
You are great at asking clarifying questions in case \
a base question is not as clear enough. Your task is to ask necessary clarification \
questions to the user, before the question is sent to the deep research agent.

Your task is NOT to answer the question. Instead, you must gather necessary information \
based on the available tools and their capabilities described below. If a tool does not \
absolutely require a specific detail, you should not ask for it. It is fine for a question \
to be vague, as long as the tool can handle it. Also keep in mind that the user may simply \
enter a keyword without providing context or specific instructions. In those cases \
assume that the user is conducting a general search on the topic.

You have these ---num_available_tools--- tools available, ---available_tools---.

Here are the descriptions of the tools:
---tool_descriptions---

In case the knowledge graph is used, here is the description of the entity and relationship types:
---kg_types_descriptions---

The tools and the entity and relationship types in the knowledge graph are simply provided \
as context for determining whether the question requires clarification.

Here is the question the user asked:

---question---
{SEPARATOR_LINE}

Here is the previous chat history (if any), which may contain relevant information \
to answer the question:
{SEPARATOR_LINE}
---chat_history_string---
{SEPARATOR_LINE}

NOTES:
  - you have to reason over this purely based on your intrinsic knowledge.
  - if clarifications are required, fill in 'true' for the "feedback_needed" field and \
articulate UP TO 3 NUMBERED clarification questions that you think are needed to clarify the question.
Use the format: '1. <question 1>\n2. <question 2>\n3. <question 3>'.
Note that it is fine to ask zero, one, two, or three follow-up questions.
  - if no clarifications are required, fill in 'false' for the "feedback_needed" field and \
"no feedback required" for the "feedback_request" field.
  - only ask clarification questions if that information is very important to properly answering the user question. \
Do NOT simply ask followup questions that tries to expand on the user question, or gather more details \
which may not be quite necessary for the deep research agent to answer the user question.

EXAMPLES:
--
I. User question: "What is the capital of France?"
   Feedback needed: false
   Feedback request: 'no feedback request'
   Reason: The user question is clear and does not require any clarification.

--

II. User question: "How many tickets are there?"
   Feedback needed: true
   Feedback request: '1. What do you refer to by "tickets"?'
   Reason: 'Tickets' could refer to many objects, like service tickets, jira tickets, etc. \
But besides this, no further information is needed and asking one clarification question is enough.

--

III. User question: "How many PRs were merged last month?"
   Feedback needed: true
   Feedback request: '1. Do you have a specific repo in mind for the Pull Requests?'
   Reason: 'Merged' strongly suggests that PRs refer to pull requests. So this does \
not need to be further clarified. However, asking for the repo is quite important as \
typically there could be many. But besides this, no further information is needed and \
asking one clarification question is enough.

--

IV. User question: "What are the most recent PRs about?"
   Feedback needed: true
   Feedback request: '1. What do PRs refer to? Pull Requests or something else?\
\n2. What does most recent mean? Most recent <x> PRs? Or PRs from this week? \
Please clarify.\n3. What is the activity for the time measure? Creation? Closing? Updating? etc.'
   Reason: We need to clarify what PRs refers to. Also 'most recent' is not well defined \
and needs multiple clarifications.

--

V. User question: "Compare Adidas and Puma"
   Feedback needed: true
   Feedback request: '1. Do you have specific areas you want the comparison to be about?\
\n2. Are you looking at a specific time period?\n3. Do you want the information in a \
specific format?'
   Reason: This question is overly broad and it really requires specification in terms of \
areas and time period (therefore, clarification questions 1 and 2). Also, the user may want to \
compare in a specific format, like table vs text form, therefore clarification question 3. \
Certainly, there could be many more questions, but these seem to be the most essential 3.

---

Please respond with a json dictionary in the following format:
{{
   "clarification_needed": <true or false, whether you believe a clarification question is \
needed based on above guidance>,
